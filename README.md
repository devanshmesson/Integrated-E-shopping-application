# Introduction 
This project is representing an e-shopping application which can be used by customers. A particular category of product is present in the database. Customers can efficiently select, safely purchase, and can get the selected product really fast at his/her doorstep.

# Motivation
**Recommendation System:**  
Motivation comes from the fact that conventional shopping is not much efficient because the shops have huge variety of products which have similar specifications or brands and as a result customer gets confused to choose the best fit product for him and as a result he may waste his money on a bad product. 

**Encryption-Decryption:**  
Motivation to make secured online transactions and conceal customer's financial information comes from the fact that during the payment process, if a hacker got successful in retrieving the OTP which is sent to the customer, then the customer will be in huge trouble because hacker can steal the customer’s money. 

**Time Efficient Shortest Path Algorithm:**  
Motivation to efficiently implement Dijkstra algorithm comes from the fact that for large number of nodes and edges, naive approaches are not efficient in terms of execution time and space.

# Problem Statement
In this pandemic, people  are forced to stay at home as it becomes risky to go outside and do shopping in crowded areas. Therefore, E-shopping becomes an easy and safe alternative for shopping goods, which also makes the experience more helpful and fulfilling for a buyer than conventional shopping. 

# Objective

1.Recommend the best and customized product for the customer on the basis of customer’s liking of brand of product, customer’s budget and reviews given by different customers who had just purchased that specific item.

2.Secured online transactions and conceal buyer's financial information using encryption-decryption 

3.Suggest the ambulance a shortest possible path as soon as possible in the real road network by applying time efficient shortest path algorithms.

# Methodology

For Recommendation System-  
2 methods are being implemented:
* Collaborative Filtering
* Sentimental Analysis

For Encryption-Decryption -  
2 methods are being implemented:
* Vi-genre Cipher
* RSA algorithm

For solving Time Efficient Shortest Path-  
4 methods are being implemented:
* Brute-force method
* Fibonacci heap implementation
* Binary heap implementation
* Bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm (Giving Least execution time)
